# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 1, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I participated in two coding contests today and secured rank: 471 in first contest and in the second contest which was 1v1 I secured a victory.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**More Info**
1. First contest: All India Contest by Mission Helix | 1 August
2. Second contest: HackerEarth | CodeArena


### Day 2: August 2, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started working on an android app named - "About me" using kotlin.

**Thoughts**: I am learning android development since the last week and this is my first app made by myself i.e. no code along project.
